Dimensionality Reduction Homework Assignment (Due 11/03/23)

Run the following for this assignment:

make derived_data/df_original_cleaned.csv\
  derived_data/df_original_cleaned_numeric.csv\
  figures/explained_variance.png\
  figures/pc1_vs_pc2.png

For this homework assignment, I am applying PCA to my flight delay dataset for the 
purposes of dimensionality reduction. I first subset only the numeric columns of 
the data (end of "R_scripts/data_clean.r"), and then applied PCA ("R_scripts/pca.r"). 
Then, we plotted the principal components against the cumulative variance explained 
("figures/explained_variance.png"). From this, we notice that the first 7-8 
components explain 100% of the variance in the data. The first 3-4 components itself 
explain over 95% of the variance in the data. When we plot PC1 vs PC2 we see a very 
interesting geographical structure in the plot ("figures/pc1_vs_pc2.png"). 
Specifically, the plot looks like a map of the United States! There is no information 
in the numeric dataframe about the flight cities or any latitudes and longitudes. 
There is only data about times and distance (in miles) between airports. Given that 
there are nearly 2 million flights in our dataset (which only represents one-third 
of 2022 flights), it makes sense that most combinations of airports around the 
country are represented such that the inherent geographical structure in the data 
is revealed by the first two principal components.
